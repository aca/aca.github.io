    <h1>The Art of Documentation</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      <span>August 10, 2025</span>
    </p>
    <section><p>Good documentation is like a map in unfamiliar territory. It guides you where you need to go, warns you of potential hazards, and helps you understand the landscape.</p><h2>Documentation as Communication</h2><p>Documentation is fundamentally about communication. It’s a conversation between the author and the reader, separated by time and space. The challenge is to anticipate what the reader needs to know, when they need to know it, and how best to convey that information.</p><h2>The Three Levels</h2><p>Effective documentation operates at three levels:</p><ol><li><strong>The What</strong>: What does this do? What problem does it solve?</li><li><strong>The How</strong>: How do I use it? What are the steps?</li><li><strong>The Why</strong>: Why was it designed this way? What are the trade-offs?</li></ol><p>Most documentation stops at the first two levels. But it’s the third level—the why—that transforms documentation from a manual into a teaching tool.</p><h2>Writing for Your Future Self</h2><p>The best motivation for writing good documentation is selfish: you’re writing for your future self. That clever solution you implemented today? In six months, you won’t remember why you did it that way. That configuration option that seemed obvious? Future you will have forgotten what it does.</p><p>Document as if you’re explaining to someone who knows nothing about the project—because that someone might be you.</p>
