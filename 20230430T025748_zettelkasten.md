Zettelkasten is the way to organize notes.
While idea itself is simple, details of how the system should work is not clear.
Right now, I'm just keep writing things in markdown, editing in vim, searching with ripgrep + fzf.

System I want is

- well-defined, minimal protocols.
- Requires minimal metadata or configurations for it.
- future-proof, tools may change but idea should remain.
- Scalability, system should work as usual even if you join whole zettels of thousands of people.
- Hackable by all people. Which means it should be written in general purposed, easy language and have simple architecture.

TODO

- Protocol
- Extendable parser
- Language server
- CLI for automation
- Static site generator
- Git integration
- System to integrate "files".
