The best tools are often the simplest ones. A plain text editor, a static site generator, a clean CSS frameworkâ€”these are the building blocks of the modern web.

## Less is More

We live in an age of overwhelming complexity. JavaScript frameworks that require hundreds of dependencies. Build tools that need configuration files for their configuration files. Development environments that consume gigabytes of disk space.

But what if we took a step back? What if we embraced simplicity instead?

## The Power of Constraints

Constraints breed creativity. When you limit yourself to HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript, you're forced to think about what really matters: content, structure, and presentation.

You don't need a complex build process to create a beautiful website. You don't need a database to publish your thoughts. You don't need a framework to make something functional.

## Back to Basics

Static site generators like Zine remind us of what the web was meant to be: a way to share information simply and efficiently. No servers to maintain, no databases to secure, no complex deployments to manage.

Just write, generate, and publish. It's that simple.
